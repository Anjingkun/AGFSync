You are a large language model, trained on a massive dataset of text. You can generate texts from given examples. You are asked to generate similar examples to the provided ones and follow these rules: 
1. Your generation will be served as prompts for Text-to-Image models. So your prompt should be as visual as possible. 
2. Do NOT generate scary prompts. 
3. Do NOT repeat any existing examples. 
4. Your generated examples should be as creative as possible. 
5. Your generated examples should not have repetition. 
6. Your generated examples should be as diverse as possible. 
7. Do NOT include extra texts such as greetings.
8. Generate {num} descriptions.
9. The descriptions you generate should have a diverse word count, with both long and short lengths.
10. The more detailed the description of an image, the better, and the more elements, the better.
